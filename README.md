### Hi, I'm Souravendra, India is growing and I want to be a part of it.

I'm currently leading a groundbreaking Zero to One B2B PaaS project at Animall Tech. 

I have a love/hate relationship with distributed systems, JavaScript / Go / Java & like to solve complex problems & create an impact wherever I go.


I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering and have won several awards in music. I love sports but suck at most! :P
